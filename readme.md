Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Begin Project

After pulling a project to your local repository, do the following:
* php composer.phar install (install the dependencies)
* npm install (install node dependencies)
* php artisan key:generate (generate application key)
* php artisan migrate --seed (migrate and seed the database with dummy data)

After each consecutive pull from a branch, run:
* php composer.phar install
* npm install
* php artisan migrate --seed
